# Cubing Contest Results

This is a place for posting results from Rubik's cube meetups. It's currently a work-in-progress, but eventually this will (hopefully) be a platform for posting contest results that anyone will be able to spin up on their own server and use for their own local community.

## Development

To set up the development environment, install Node JS, clone this repository and then run these commands in the root directory of the project:

```bash
.githooks/init
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
